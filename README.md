## üìà Market Master ‚Äî Component-Weighted Hourly Index Prediction MLOps Pipeline

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/concept_diagram.png" alt="Concept Diagram" width="500" />
</div>

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts the next-hour trading action for each major stock in an index, then combines these into a single weighted signal for the index itself (e.g., NASDAQ-100 ‚Üí /NQ). The system uses historical price data, technical indicators, and a trained model to give clear buy, sell, or hold signals for index futures trading.

---

## Problem
Index futures like NASDAQ-100 (/NQ) are a popular way to trade the overall direction of the market, especially for tech-heavy portfolios. The index is made up of many constituent stocks ‚Äî companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia ‚Äî each assigned a specific weight based on its market value. Larger companies influence the index more. Traders watch the index because it acts as a single benchmark for multiple companies, but its movement is really the result of all constituents combined.

Manually tracking dozens of stocks, calculating indicators, and then deciding the next move for the index is challenging. Each stock may give different signals, and without a structured way to combine them, decisions can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to emotional bias.

## Solution
Our system automates this process using machine learning and a clear aggregation method. Every hour, we collect OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for the top-weighted NASDAQ-100 stocks. For each stock, we compute technical features and indicators, then predict the next hour‚Äôs price movement using a trained model. Each prediction is mapped to a score ‚Äî from strong buy to strong sell ‚Äî and weighted according to the stock‚Äôs influence in the index.

These weighted scores are combined into a Weighted Sentiment Score (WSS), representing the predicted direction of the index for the next hour. If the WSS exceeds a buy threshold, we issue a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù signal for index futures; if it falls below a sell threshold, we issue a ‚Äúsell‚Äù signal; otherwise, we hold.

This approach ensures consistent, data-driven decisions, removes human guesswork, and allows traders to act confidently on the likely direction of the index in the coming hour ‚Äî ideal for trading index derivatives.

### Solution overview 
- 1‚Äëhour OHLCV for index constituents (top‚Äë10 QQQ in MVP).
- Pooled training across constituents with a symbol feature; multiple candidates compared; champion selected.
- Per‚Äësymbol predictions aggregated to WSS to emit an /NQ signal; logged to MLflow.
- Champion served via FastAPI, loading from MLflow Model Registry alias `@Production`.

### üíº Business impact
- **Consistency in decisions**: Clear actions (strong_sell/sell/hold/buy/strong_buy) per constituent reduce emotional noise.
- **Operational efficiency**: Automates multi‚Äëindicator synthesis; hourly index‚Äëlevel signal for faster decisioning.
- **Risk awareness**: Per‚Äëclass probabilities enable confidence‚Äëbased thresholds and risk controls.
- **Path to scale**: Structure extends to full NASDAQ‚Äë100, registry‚Äëbased promotion, and cloud later.

## üöÄ Features
- Pooled training and model comparison (RF/ET/GB/HGBT/MLP/SVC/LogReg) with MLflow nested runs; champion persisted.
- MLflow Model Registry integration with aliases (Staging/Production); API serves `models:/market-master-component-classifier@Production`.
- Per‚Äësymbol predictions and WSS aggregation for index signal; logs artifacts/metrics to MLflow.
- Monitoring with Evidently (drift and classification quality); gating criteria and promotion utility.
- FastAPI with `/health`, `GET /predict/component`, `GET /signal/index`, and `POST /predict`.

**Note**: The POST endpoint requires at least 21 bars of historical data due to rolling window calculations (20-period warm-up + 1 current bar). For daily use, prefer the GET endpoints which use stored CSV data.
Response includes `action` in {"strong_sell","sell","hold","buy","strong_buy"} and per‚Äëclass probabilities.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Readiness
  The project is structured for easy grading and local execution.

- **Problem description**: Clearly defined 1‚Äëhour constituent signals aggregated to an index decision.
- **Cloud**: Local‚Äëonly with Docker containerization for reproducibility.
- **Experiment tracking & registry**: MLflow tracking implemented; Model Registry with aliases implemented.
- **Workflow orchestration**: Local runner (`src/run_pipeline.py`) and Windows Task Scheduler for hourly runs; Prefect flow included as optional.

- **Monitoring**: Evidently drift and classification quality reports saved to `data/monitoring/` and logged to MLflow.
- **Reproducibility**: Pinned requirements, deterministic seeds, tests, and Docker containerization.
- **Best practices**: 
  - ‚úÖ **Unit tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering features, pipeline, and MLOps components
  - ‚úÖ **Integration tests**: API endpoint testing with FastAPI TestClient
  - ‚úÖ **Linter and formatter**: Black (code formatting), isort (import sorting), flake8 (linting), mypy (type checking)
  - ‚úÖ **Makefile**: Comprehensive development and deployment commands
  - ‚úÖ **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated code quality checks before commits
  - ‚úÖ **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing, linting, and pipeline smoke tests

## üîß Configuration (Local)
Environment variables are optional. Defaults are embedded for local use.
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: `sqlite:///mlflow.db`
- `MODEL_URI`: `models:/market-master-component-classifier@Production` (API tries this first; falls back to `artifacts/model/model.pkl`)


---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- Expand to full NASDAQ‚Äë100 constituents and improve symbol metadata.
